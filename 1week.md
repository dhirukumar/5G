# keyword that we learn in this 1week
## 1. we learned that wireless communication use radio-frequency signals, also known as RF, to transfer information over the air between transmitter and a receiver. 
## 2. A wireless transmission is an electromagnetic signal, which is characterized by its wavelength and frequency.
## 3. Factors that affect data rate, are signal-to-noise ratio, channel capacity, network load, and spectral efficiency. Cellular coverage areas are divided into cells, each served by a base station, and the cells are designed to have overlapping coverage for seamless user mobility.
## 4. Radio access network, also known as RAN, provides wireless connection to users and then the core network connects to the RAN to the service of the networks.

A wireless channel is a specific division of frequencies in a specific wireless band. It can be defined as the medium between two end points of a communication system.

A transmitter and receiver pair is a device that transmits and receives radio signals. The transmitter is the source of the signal, and the receiver is the destination.
