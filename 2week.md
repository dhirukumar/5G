## 1.Approximately every 10 years a new generation of cellular technology has been developed, starting with 1G in the 1980s to the current fifth generation.
## 2.5G aims to meet new requirements by providing an increase in throughput, spectral efficiency, capacity, network efficiency, density and a decrease in end to end latency. 
## 3.eMBB, mMTC and URLLC are three prominent service classes 5G is expected to enable.
