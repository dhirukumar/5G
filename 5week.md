# keyword that learn in this week

## we covered many aspects of Massive MIMO, which is one of the key techniques to fully meet 5G requirements. Let's quickly remember some key takeaways.
### 1.Massive MIMO is an extension of MIMO and entails many more antennas on the base station.
### 2.Beamforming can work on both mobile devices and base stations to focus wireless signal in a specific direction rather than broadcasting to a wide area. 
### 3.Horizontal and vertical beamforming together provide 3D coverage. 
### 4.Benefits of Massive MIMO and beamforming include increased capacity, increased coverage, and millimeter-wave enablement.
